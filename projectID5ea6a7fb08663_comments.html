<HTML><BODY>Beside the number of Dutch language books on South Africa, that typically take the pro-Boer side, it is also good to add a few books in English, that take a different position. This book details the history of the complicated relation between the South African "Boers" and the English empire, that culminated in the Boer war, which, at that time was extremely violent -- of course completely overshadowed by the later world wars -- and included such "innovations" as concentration camps.

<p>Not many technical problems with the text, so have fun!
